### WEIRD BEHAVIORS --> EV TODOs


# PRIO 1



# PRIO 2



# PRIO 3
 New turn. turns_left: 14
 Roll #2
Values: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Values: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Saving: [2, 2]
Aiming for: twos
    - would be better to aim for ones here.
    - this would also happen if I had [2, 2, 2, 4, 4]
    - not sure how to fix it though...



# PRIO 4
- Kan det här fortfarande hända? Jag fattar ingenting...
Stupid decision:
 New turn. turns_left: 3
 Roll #1
Values: [1, 4, 4, 6, 6]
Values: [1, 4, 4, 6, 6]
Saving: [6, 6]
Aiming for: three of a kind
 Roll #2
Values: [2, 3, 3, 6, 6]
Values: [2, 3, 3, 6, 6]
Saving: [2, 3]
Aiming for: small straight
