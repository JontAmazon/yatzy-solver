SOLVER_DESCRIPTION = """
Solver 2. Algorithm: \n
1. Call "get_expected_scores": For each combination, get the \n
expected score you would get if aiming solely at that combination. \n
    # NOTE: This function should also return a "save" list for each combination. \n
2. From each combination, subtract "COST_FUNCTION". \n
3. For each combination, multiply with "WEIGH_FUNCTION", since some combinations \n
are more important than others. For example, it is very important to get lots of \n
fours/fives/sixes in the upper section. \n
Hence we get a value for each combination. Call this dict "combination_value". \n

If not rolls_left:
    final_choice = max(combination_value)
elif rolls_left:
    max("combination_value") --> match with "save" from "get_expected_scores"
