# PRIO 2
- improve straights:
    let "get_expected_scores" take scoreboard as input, and:
    - hard-code: when both small and large straight left, increase expected value of the straights when values have [2,3,4,5].
    - increase expected value of straights when few turns left and nothing important left?
